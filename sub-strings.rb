# function substring accepts two arguments: a word (string)
# and a dictionary (array)

# create empty hash 'counts' with argument 0
# for each substring element in dictionary:
    # set word to lowercase
    # set substring to lowercase
    # check if word includes that substring
        # add substring as key to counts

    # return counts
